# User Data Streams for Binance (2020-04-25)
# General WSS information
* The base API endpoint is: **https://api.binance.com**
* A User Data Stream `listenKey` is valid for 60 minutes after creation.
* Doing a `PUT` on an active `listenKey` will extend its validity for 60 minutes.
* Doing a `DELETE` on an active `listenKey` will close the stream and invalidate the `listenKey`.
* Doing a `POST` on an account with an active `listenKey` will return the currently active `listenKey` and extend its validity for 60 minutes.
* The base websocket endpoint is: **wss://stream.binance.com:9443**
* User Data Streams are accessed at **/ws/\<listenKey\>** or **/stream?streams=\<listenKey\>**
* A single connection to **stream.binance.com** is only valid for 24 hours; expect to be disconnected at the 24 hour mark

}
```

**Execution types:**

* NEW - The order has been accepted into the engine.
* CANCELED - The order has been canceled by the user. 
* REPLACED (currently unused)
* REJECTED - The order has been rejected and was not processed. (This is never pushed into the User Data Stream)
* TRADE - Part of the order or all of the order's quantity has filled.
* EXPIRED - The order was canceled according to the order type's rules (e.g. LIMIT FOK orders with no fill, LIMIT IOC or MARKET orders that partially fill) or by the exchange, (e.g. orders canceled during liquidation, orders canceled during maintenance)

If the order is an OCO, an event will be displayed named `ListStatus` in addition to the `executionReport` event.
